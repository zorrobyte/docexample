# What is KubeCost?

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

**Kubecost helps you monitor and manage cost and capacity in Kubernetes environments.** We integrate with your infrastructure to help your team track, manage, and reduce spend.

We offer a [open source project](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-model) as well as the [Commercial Kubecost product](http://kubecost.com/) with a generous [free tier](https://www.kubecost.com/pricing).

In this repository, you'll learn how to deploy your own Kubernetes cluster from the ground up on DigitalOcean using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) for configuration management, [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm/) for automating the installation and configuration of Kubernetes components, and finally, [KubeCost](https://www.kubecost.com) for cost and capacity tracking.
