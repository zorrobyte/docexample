I really think KubeCost is an awesome product and it's a no-brainer for every k8s deployment! I'm not aware of any other tool that goes into such depth and has the featureset we are building out, which is why I'm so passionate about the opportunity to support the product!

Views such as Cluster Health can really help a customer uncover potentional future pain points before it even becomes a problem and cost optimization can really help customers reinvest in their product instead of infra spend.

I've often dreamed of such a tool in my career supporting customers in a cloud enviorment, countless cases could be resolved before they are even created if customers had the insight that KubeCost provides.

We have a bright future ahead of us!



Oh, and we could totally use a team mascot. My vote is for a fun loving Rhino with a toolbelt and hard hat!
