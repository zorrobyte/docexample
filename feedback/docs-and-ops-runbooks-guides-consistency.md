# Docs & Ops Runbooks, Guides consistency

* It seems as if we use several different backend systems for docs:

Guides:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

Docs:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

Why is there a "Submit a Request" link when users can also create issues on Github? Seems fragmented and can be confusing to customers.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

Merging our customer and internal facing docs into a single system (like Gitbooks, this doc's repo platform) will reduce fragmentation and ease of use for support, customers to report, update, and add docs as we grow. Managing several systems never scales well and does not inspire collabration.

I'm not yet sure if we have internal runbooks, but an indexed, searchable repo is key to efficent firefighting.
