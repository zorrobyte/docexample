# Pricing Page

We have a nice HTML page behind Learn More for the Free version, but the links behind the Learn More for Business and Enterprise dumps the user to a GitHub Markdown document:

{% embed url="https://github.com/kubecost/docs/blob/master/enterprise.md" %}

It would be nice to see polished marketing pages for the paid tiers and it feels a little backwards for only the Free option to have polished HTML pages.
