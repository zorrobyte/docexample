# Installing KubeCost

### Before you begin

In order to deploy the Kubecost helm chart you'll need to install Helm 3 on your local machine:

****[**Install Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)****

Next, you'll need to configure a [`PersistentVolumeClaim`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PVC) as part of your [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/). The claim can allow cluster workers to read and write database records, user-generated website content, log files, and other data that should persist after a process has completed. This is required for KubeCost to function correctly.

Note that manually configuring PVCs is time consuming and highly varies per use case so I've omitted the specific steps for this homework assignment
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: Install Kubecost

Running the following commands will also install Prometheus, Grafana, and kube-state-metrics in the namespace supplied. View install configuration options [here](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/master/README.md#config-options).

**helm 3**

```
kubectl create namespace kubecost 
helm repo add kubecost https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/ 
helm install kubecost kubecost/cost-analyzer --namespace kubecost --set kubecostToken="em9ycm9ieXRlQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==xm343yadf98"
```

### Step 2: Enable port-forward

```
kubectl port-forward --namespace kubecost deployment/kubecost-cost-analyzer 9090
```

Having installation issues? View our [Troubleshooting Guide](http://docs.kubecost.com/troubleshoot-install) or contact us directly at team@kubecost.com.

### Step 3: See the data! ðŸŽ‰

You can now view the deployed frontend by visiting the following link. Publish :9090 as a secure endpoint on your cluster to remove the need to port forward.

```
http://localhost:9090
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that if you receive a No Clusters Found, Cluster not available error, wait a few minutes and try again. KubeCost can take a moment to start

With this newfound visibility, teams often start with&#x20;

1. Looking at cost allocation trends&#x20;
2. Searching for quick cost savings or reliability improvements. View our [Getting Started](http://docs.kubecost.com/#getting-started) guide for more information on product configuration and common initial actions.

### Bonus

How many of these health checks can you resolve?

### Updating KubeCost

Now that your Kubecost chart is installed, you can update with the following commands:

**helm 2**

```
helm repo update && helm upgrade kubecost kubecost/cost-analyzer file_copy
```

**helm 3**

```
helm repo update && helm upgrade kubecost kubecost/cost-analyzer -n kubecost
```

### Deleting KubeCost

To uninstall Kubecost and its dependencies, run the following command:

**helm 2**

```
helm del --purge kubecost file_copy
```

**helm 3**

```
helm uninstall kubecost -n kubecost
```
